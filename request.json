      "prompt": "I have an idea to make a belt that dog walkers could put around their waist when they take their dogs for a walk and carry things that they typically need for a dog walk.  The belt would be made of sturdy materials with mil-spec webbing for the belt and the attached pouches would be made of touch canvas or nylon cordura. The belt would have three pouches attached, one that could hold two tennis balls, one that holds dog poop bags and one that could be used to carry personal items like a a wallet, phone, earbuds etc. The belt would have two strong attachment points, one on either side, that would all the user to attach a dog's leash.  The belt would be styled with outdoors-type colors, such as olive drab, desert coyote, or possible classic plaid patterns.  The idea is to appeal to outdoors people and be rugged without being too colorful. What I need to determine is the potential price-points that I should target for this type of product, where it could be made (manufacture to hire), the viability of the idea (e.g. is there a market for it), and other things to either add to the product or other considerations to make it more relevant, useful and compelling for a consumer. I'd like a list of co-manufacturers in the domestic US or abroad that I could approach to help me make the product. "
